"We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, What is our policy? I will say; "It is to wage war, by <span class="sea">sea</span>, <span class="land">land</span> and <span class="air">air</span>, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us: to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy." You ask, What is our aim? I can answer with one word: <span class="victory">Victory</span> - <span class="victory">victory</span> at all costs, <span class="victory">victory</span> in spite of all terror, <span class="victory">victory</span> however long and hard the road may be; for without <span class="victory">victory</span> there is no survival."<br/>
(Sir Winston Churchill, to the House of Commons on May 13, 1940 in his first address as the newly appointed Prime Minister.)
